# Burger
Homework - Node, Express, MySQL, Heroku, Handlebars

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run npm i to install all dependencies.  In your database manager (mySQL Workbench, Tables, etc.), configure your db and run the burger_db_ss.sql file to create the db and seed it.

You will also need to update the connection.js file in the config folder to mirror your database connection.

### Prerequisites

You will need a database (mySQL) and node installed and running on your machine.
Other than that, just follow the "Getting Started" instructions to get going.

### Installing

See Prerequisites and Getting Started sections

### Deployed App on Heroku

* [Heroku](https://burger-noms.herokuapp.com/) - live and humming

## Running the tests

No tests are currently included.

### Break down into end to end tests

No tests are currently included.

### And coding style tests

No tests are currently included.

## Deployment

The app will work locally once all "Getting Started" instructions have been followed.
To deploy to Heroku, as I have done, follow their instructions for getting an account and setting it up.  You will also need to provision and set up a dB on Heroku. I used JawsDB and it was quite easy to get up and running - recommended!

## Built With

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - runtime for javascript
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - node routing
* [mySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) - mysql driver for node
* [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - templating engine
